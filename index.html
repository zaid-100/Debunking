 <h1> Debunking some opinions on muslims </h1>
    <p>
    Although my cause on the wdd server is different, i wanted to choose this cause to work on because it's a topic which is close to my identity and is important. <br>
        To begin, i should first clarify why i think that public opinion on muslims in general is a problem to start with and how i might deal with these concerns. Note: all the articles and research Cited in this document will be attached to the notes page.
    </p>
    <h2> How to fix the general misconceptions</h2>
    <ul> <li>To first address the issue i must first make it clear to the people who are unfamiliar with the topic, that the issue actually exists. Some quick facts and survey statistics with hyperlinks to actual studies would help accomplish this.</li>
        <li> I must make the entire "debunking" document brief to not go overboard.</li>
        <li> Use infographics to reinforce those statistics </li>
        <li> Give an incomplete statistic with a prior warning for misinformation, for example: <br> "76% muslims from pakistan want sharia law for the country." </li>
        <li> Complete the statistic with second "clarification" statement:<br>
            "But generally believe it should only be applied to muslims and is malleable in interpretation of the individual" </li>
        <li> Fill the gap by shedding light on the fact that islamophobia is an issue created by certain politically motivated people. Whether it is terrorist organizations such as ISIS or the ones spreading the hate rhetoric, the incentive for both parties is political. </li>
        
        
        
    </ul>    
    <h2> The Problem </h2>
    <p> Time after time we see acts of extremism in the west against muslim civilians. According to <a href= "https://www.thedailybeast.com/more-than-500-attacks-on-muslims-in-america-this-year ">an article from the daily beast</a>, "Islamophobia watchdogs have identified more than 500 potentially anti-Muslim incidents in the U.S. since the start of the year", till 21st may 2019.<a href = "https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/09/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/"> Another article from pew-research </a> found that nearly half (49%) of the americans believe that at least “some” U.S. Muslims are anti-American, greater than the share who say “just a few” or “none” are anti-American. So it should be, at this point, self-evident that islamophobia is a real issue. </p>
    <h2> A concession and rebuttal</h2>
    <p> As a muslim myself, i concede here that some ideas of the muslim faith may not be in sync with the ideas of western society, for example, the idea of gay marriage. However, this belief is centred around individuals and not as a law. The phrase "islamic law" or "sharia" in itself is meaningless unless the context is given. There is no absolute islamic law for society as there is no written document for "sharia" law. it doesn't exist; and what countries adopt in today's day are nit-picked modes of being described in the Quran which I and many other muslims like myself disagree with because the interpretation is subject to change.</p>
    <p1> Note: the phrase "sharia law" can be misleading in the pew news article , titled "The world's Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society", because it, itself, concedes that "Muslims who want to make sharia law the law of the country generally agree that requirements of islam should apply only to muslims." </p1> <br>
    <p1> Moreover, it says, "The survey also shows that Muslims differ widely in how they interpret certain aspects of islamic teachings." which means that whatever percentage of people agree with the imposition of "sharia law", the specifics are known only to the individual and for the individual. Most of the laws have nothing to do with society as a whole. </p1>
